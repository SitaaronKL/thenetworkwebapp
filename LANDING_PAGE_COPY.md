## FAQ Section

**Section Heading:**
QUESTIONS? ANSWERS.

### FAQ Items:

**1. What is TheNetwork?**
TheNetwork is a social networking application that helps users discover and connect with other people based on shared interests. With the user's explicit permission, the app reads YouTube subscriptions and liked videos using the YouTube Data API (read-only scope only). This data is used solely to understand user interests and to make people discovery and recommendations feel intentional rather than random.

**2. What happens after I sign up?**
After connecting your Google account, we'll analyze your YouTube activity to create your "Digital DNA", a unique profile of your interests, personality archetypes, and the creators who shape your worldview. You'll see a personalized summary of who you are based on your digital footprint, then you can start discovering and connecting with like-minded people.

**3. Who will I meet on TheNetwork?**
You'll meet real people who share your genuine interests, not random followers or bots. Whether you're into niche hobbies, specific creators, or broader topics, we connect you with others who truly resonate with what you care about. Think of it as finding your tribe based on what you actually watch, not just what you say you like.

**4. How does TheNetwork use my YouTube data?**
We analyze your YouTube subscriptions and liked videos to understand your genuine interests: the creators you follow, the topics you engage with. This helps us match you with people who share similar passions and curiosities. We only use read-only access, meaning we can never post, modify, or delete anything on your YouTube account.

**5. Is my data shared with anyone?**
No, your data is never sold or shared with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. Your YouTube data is used exclusively within TheNetwork to improve your experience and help you find like-minded people. We take your privacy seriously.

**6. How do you match me with other people?**
We use your YouTube signals, specifically your subscriptions and liked videos, to build a profile of your interests. Our matching algorithm then identifies other users with overlapping interests, helping you discover people who genuinely share your passions rather than random connections.

**7. Can I revoke access to my data?**
Yes, absolutely. You can revoke TheNetwork's access to your YouTube data at any time through your Google Account permissions. You can also delete your account within the app, which will remove all your data from our systems.

**8. What happens if I delete my account?**
When you delete your account, all your personal data, including any cached YouTube data, is permanently removed from our systems. Your connections and any content you've shared will also be deleted. This action cannot be undone.

## Signals Explanation Modal

**Title:**
What are signals?

**Content:**
Your signals are the digital breadcrumbs you leave behind: the YouTube channels you subscribe to, the videos you like, the content you engage with.

From a neuroscience perspective, what you watch is what you're genuinely interested in, and that's something you can't fake. In a world where connection can feel lonely and random, we wanted to create something that makes sense for you to use and feel confident using.

We started with a small experiment with 20 friends. The success rate of finding new people who were very similar to each other was remarkably high. That small scale experiment convinced us to make this a large scale experiment, and here we are.

We use your signals to connect you with people who share what you actually care about, based on what you genuinely watch, not just what you say you like.
